## PSD Art Tools

`munge_psds.py` is the script the extracts `.png` images from `.psd` files based on the name of the layer/group.

To use this script, you must install [psd_tools](https://github.com/psd-tools/psd-tools).

Given the tempestuous nature of installing python packages, how to do that is beyond the scope of this README.  If you have decent _pythonfu_, this shouldn't be a probem.
