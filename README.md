Technical stacks and tools: Dinky language, wimpy, Sublime text, Texture Packer, Photoshop

Hello,

This is a demo created by Tu Nguyen (Lucian) to apply to the Gameplay Programmer 
position at Terrible Toybox.

I don’t own the sounds, artworks, engine, characters or anything except the idea and 
20 rolls of paper which I hoarded since last lockdown.

I've made this demo within 3 days including time to learn the language and the project structure
so to avoid crashing the game, I left most of the demo as it was and just added or edited what 
I want. To look for where I edited, you can search keyword "IT-PARODY-DEMO" in the whole project.

I don’t have much time to research more this demo is almost just a customization of the prototype 
“Thimbleweed Park: A mini-adventure”. However, I managed to know how to use Wimpy to add new objects 
and walkbox, edit the dialogue using tsv files and play with Photoshop files and the sprite sheets,
which makes me so excited that I went out and bought other 20 rolls of toilet paper to celebrate.

So, thank you and enjoy!
